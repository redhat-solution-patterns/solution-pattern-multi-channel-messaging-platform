== Demonstration

The Demo primarily showcases how the combination of key Red Hat technologies are strategically used to deliver a cloud-native, unified collaboration platform. The concept can easily be leveraged to various other scenarios, but in this case, the demo focusses on a customer support multi-channel service.

The sections below will help you walk through the essentials of installing and running the demo. Even though many technologies are at play, the demo is straightforward to showcase centring around the following bullet points:

  - Initiate a customer support session using _Rocket.Chat_
  - Simulate a collaborative conversation between the customer and multiple support members (teams).
  - Close a session and trigger the process to archive a transcript.
  - Play a conversation using the Globex Web portal channel.
  - Extend the platform by creating and plugging a new customer channel.

=== Prerequisites

You will require:

- An _OpenShift Container Platform_ cluster running version 4.15 or above with cluster admin access.
- _Docker, Podman or Ansible_ installed and running. +
[NOTE]
  To run the demo's _Ansible Playbook_ to deploy it you'll need one of the above. If none of them is installed on your machine we suggest installing _Docker_ using the most recent Docker version. See the https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[Docker Engine installation documentation^] for further information.
+ 
[TIP]
  You'll find more information below on how to use _Podman_ or _Ansible_ as alternatives to _Docker_.

### Provision an OpenShift environment

1. Provision the following _Red Hat Demo Platform_ (RHDP) item:
+
--
* https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/community-content.com-multi-channel.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link[**Solution Pattern - Build an extendable Multi-Channel Messaging Platform**^]
+
image:29-rhdp-card.png[,30%,link=https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/community-content.com-multi-channel.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link, window=_blank]
+
[NOTE]
=====
* The provisioning of the RHDP card above will just prepare for you a base environment (OCP). You still need to deploy the demo by running the installation process described below. +
* The provisioning process takes around 80-90 minutes to complete. You need to wait its completion before proceeding to the demo installation.
=====

+
{empty} +

1. Alternatively, if you don't have access to RHDP, ensure you have an _OpenShift_ environment available.
[TIP]
  You can obtain one by deploying the trial version available at https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it[Try Red Hat OpenShift^].

== Walkthrough guide

The guide below will help you to familiarise with the main components in the demo, and how to operate it to demonstrate the characteristics of this _Solution Pattern_.

{empty} +

=== Quick Topology Overview

Because the automated installation process reuses deployment scripts from other lab resources, the platform components are split in three main namespaces:

- `globex-im-platforms`: where the main instant messaging platforms are deployed, namely _Rocket.Chat_ and _Matrix_. The _Apache Camel_ integration for _Rocket.Chat_ is also included here.

- `globex-integrations`: where all the main _Apache Camel_ integrations are deployed. Also in this namespace you'll find the _Globex Web_ portal, an instance of Data Grid and S3 storage with _Minio_ where conversation transcripts are stored.

- `globex-mw`: where the _AMQ Streams_ (_Kafka_) instance used by the platform is deployed.

To have scattered components across different namespaces doesn't help to intuitively understand the overall architecture.

The picture below shows a convenient composition of all three namespaces illustrating all the relationships and interactions involved in the solution.

{empty} +

A more schematic view which maps closely to the composition view above is the following:

.Schematic Overview of the Platform on OpenShift
image::15-demo-diagram-full.png[,100%]

{empty} +

=== Initiate a support session

Open your _OpenShift_ console with your given admin credentials and follow the instructions below:

. Select from the left menu the _Developer_ view:
- Click the _Administrator_ button and select _Developer_ from the drop down.
. Use the filter `globex` in the search textbox.
. Find and select the project `globex-im-platforms`
. Make sure you display the _Topologoy_ view (left menu)

You should see a number of deployments in your screen. Find among them the _RocketChat_ application and open it by clicking the route link as shown below:

image::16-demo-rocket-onboarding.png[,100%]

The login window to the _Rocket Chat_ application will show in a new tab. +
Enter the following credentials:

- **username**: `user1`
- **Password**: `openshift`

[NOTE]
_Rocket.chat_ here represents the customer's entry point to access the support channel and have conversations with support agents. Agents are not _Rochet.chat_ users, they use other collaboration tools, elsewhere, which are also plugged to the multi-channel platform.

To start a support session, select the channel created for `user1`:

- `globex-support-user1`

image::17-demo-rocket-channel-start.png[,100%]

Then, pretend you are a customer by typing a message and sending it. +
For example:

> Hello, can I get help please?


{empty} +

Now, let's switch to the agent's system. +
From _OpenShift_'s _Topology_ view, find the _Element_ application.

[NOTE]
_Element_ is the front facing interface application that connects to the _Matrix_ server.

To open _Matrix_, click _Element_'s route link and then click `Sign in` as shown below:

image::18-demo-matrix-onboarding.png[,100%]

The login window to _Matrix_ will show in a new tab. +
Enter the following credentials:

- **username**: `user2`
- **Password**: `openshift`

[NOTE]
_Matrix_ here represents the collaboration tool agents use to assist customer enquiries. _Matrix_ is integrated with the multi-channel platform and serves in the demo to show one of many tools from where different groups and partners could connect from.

As soon as you login, on the left panel of the window, you'll see an entry in your list of invites:

- `rocketchat-user1`

The invite was generated the moment the customer sent the initial message to request assistance.

Accept the invitation by following the actions below illustrated:

image::19-demo-matrix-invite-accept.png[,100%]

Once accepted, you'll see the message the customer sent (from _Rocket.chat_) in the main conversation area.

To follow with the simulated conversation, now pretend you are the support agent and type back a welcome message. +
For example:

- Agent (1st line):
+
--
> Hi, what can I do for you today?
-- 

The diagram below illustrates the end-to-end traffic flow you've just enacted:

.Data flow between customer and 1st line support
image::20-demo-diagram-flow-first-line.png[,100%]



{empty} +


=== Simulate simultaneous Support teams

The _Solution Pattern_ proposes a platform where multiple communication systems, internal and external, are integrated.

However, on the agent's end, the demo only includes one system (_Matrix_). It's not ideal, but it doesn't stop us from simulating different groups participating in the same support session.



// However, the demo only includes one (_Matrix_) from where support agents operate, not ideal, but still allows us to simulate different groups participating in the same support session.

Earlier, the first team to respond was _"1st line Support"_. Now we introduce a new agent, member of the _"Technical Support"_ team.

[NOTE]
Since we just have _Matrix_, let's just pretend the _Technical Support_ team is connecting from a different IM system, not _Matrix_. From the demo's perspective nothing changes.

Let's resume the conversation between the customer and the support teams. 

Go back to _Rocket.chat_, put your customer's hat on, and describe the problem to the agent, for example:

- Customer:
+
--
> When I browse the products, the wheel keeps spinning.
--

When the message is sent and the agent reads it in _Matrix_, he answers and explains the technical team will take over:

- Agent (1st line):
+
--
> Please wait a moment, a member of the technical team will assist.
--

{empty} +

Now, from the _OpenShift Developer_ view, you will open a new window from where the new technical agent will communicate.

From _OpenShift_'s _Topology_ view, find the _Element_ application.

Open your _OpenShift_ console with your given admin credentials and follow the instructions below:

. Make sure you display the _Topologoy_ view (left menu)
. Find and select the project `globex-integrations`

From your _Topology_ view, open _Matrix_ by following the actions below described:

[TIP]
We open _Element_ in an _Incognito_ window to avoid entering in conflict with your previous _Matrix_ session.

. Click the _Element_ deployment disc
. Find and click the `Resources` tab
. Copy the _Route_ URL
. Open an incognito window and paste the URL address
. Enter the Sign-In process in _Element_

You should end up viewing the Login prompt as shown below:

image::23-demo-incognito-login.png[,100%]

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure you use a different username to simulate the _"Technical Support"_ agent, for example `user3`.

- **username**: `user3`
- **Password**: `openshift`

Again, you'll find in the left panel an invite to the room where the customer is being attended:

- `rocketchat-user1`

Accept the invitation by following the actions below illustrated:

image::24-demo-matrix-invite-accept-technical.png[,100%]

Once accepted, you'll see the entire conversation history.

Now pretend you are the technical agent and respond to the customer. +
For example:

- Agent (technical team):
+
--
> Hi, I'm from the technical team. We just completed an update, please try again.
--

When you send the response, it should pop up in _Rocket.chat._

In the _Rocket.chat_ channel you'll see now responses from 2 different agents. The first was a _"1st line Support"_ agent, and the second a _"Technical Support"_ agent.

[NOTE]
As previously explained, in the demo, both agents are connecting from _Matrix_, but the _Solution Pattern_ allows other IM platforms to plug in.

Let's assume the problem was resolved and the customer responds with:

- Customer:
+
--
> Thanks, I confirm I can now browse the products.
--

The diagram below illustrates the end-to-end traffic flow you've recreated involving the _Technical Support_ team:

.Data flow between customer and technical support
image::21-demo-diagram-flow-technical.png[,100%]


{empty} +


=== Close the session and archive the conversation

One of the features the Solution Pattern showcases is the ability to integrate pluggable services in the background.

To demonstrate the ability to plugin services, we've implemented an integration process that reacts when a customer support session ends. When a conversation is closed, the process listens to the signal and generates a transcript and is pushed to object storage (S3).

[NOTE]
The background context is that the organisation is obligated to meet certain security policies and Government regulations. All communications need to be kept for a certain period to comply with the established data retention policies.

The diagram below illustrates what happens when the customer session ends.

Kafka is used to replay customer/agent messages. The figure above shows traffic directed to kafka and consumed, processed and persisted by Camel. 

Let's now see the functionality in action by ending the customer support session.

From the _Matrix_ system, pretend you're the technical agent and send the following message to the customer:

- Agent (technical team):
+
--
> Anything else I can do for you?
--

As the customer, you could follow with:

- Customer:
+
--
> No, thanks for your assistance.
--

And then for politeness, the agent could respond:

- Agent (technical team):
+
--
> You're welcome, I will close now the conversation.
--

{empty} +

Once this formal chit-chat out of the way, from _Matrix_ follow the actions below to close the room:

. In the left panel, right click the room
. Click `Leave`

image::25-demo-matrix-channel-leave.png[,50%]

When prompted, click `Leave` in the confirmation window.

Not only the actions above close the conversation in _Matrix_, but also, in the background, it triggers the process to generate and archive the transcript.

In a matter of seconds, the customer receives a message in Rochet.chat with a link to the transcript.

Click the `PDF transcript` to open it in your browser, as illustrated below.

.Link to transcript in Rockat.chat
image::26-demo-rchat-transcript.png[,100%]

What the process did when the conversation was closed was the following sequence of actions:

. Replay the full stream of messages stored in Kafka
. Aggregate the messages
. Format the content in PDF
. Push the PDF file to S3 storage
. Obtain a shareable URL of resource in S3
. Send a message to _Rocket.chat_ to share the URL

The diagram below describes the processes involved:

.Data flow to deliver transcript to customer
image::22-demo-diagram-flow-transcript.png[,100%]

{empty} +



=== Get support from the Web Portal channel

Up until now, all your customer interactions have been done from _Rocket.Chat_, but this is a multi-channel platform.

Let's try out the support service from the Globex Web Portal.

Open your _OpenShift_ console with your given admin credentials and follow the instructions below:

. Make sure you display the _Topologoy_ view (left menu)
. Find and select the project `globex-integrations`

You should see a number of deployments in your screen. Find among them the _Globex Web_ application and follow the actions below described:

. Click the route link from the `globex-web` deployment.
. In the web page, find the `Login` option in the top bar and click it
. You will be proxied to the Single-Sign-On window.
+
--
Enter the following credentials:

- **username**: `asilva`
- **Password**: `openshift`
--
+
. Click the _Chat_ blue icon


image::27-demo-globex-login.png[,100%]


After completing the above steps (as illustrated), you should be presented with the Globex Web Chat interface where you can type in messages to the support team.

In the Chat window, exchange a few messages with the support team, and end the conversation as previously done with the _Rocket.chat_ example.

The diagram below shows how data flows via the Globex Web integration.

.Data flow between Globex and support

Below you have a sample conversation and the transcript produced out of it.

image::28-demo-globex-conversation.png[,100%]

{empty} +



=== Integrate a new 3rd party system

You've used so far two customer chat systems currently plugged to the platform (_Rocket.chat_ and _Globex Web Chat_).

This section demonstrates the extensibility design of the platform to connect a new communication channel. All there is to do is to create an integration that produces/consumes messages to/from AMQ and complies with the data schemas.

Let's continue by:

. Explaining the basics of both request/response flows
. Deploying and testing the new partner integration.

{empty} +

==== Overview of request/response flows

===== Request flow

Let's start with the request flow, where the new system pushes messages from customers to the messaging broker.

.Data flow pushing messages to AMQ
image::31-demo-extend-platform-request-flow.png[,70%,align=center]

You could use any integration framework you'd like. We use _Apache Camel_ for its versatility, ease of use and proven track record.

The key Camel route to enable the above data flow is shown in this snippet:

[source,java]
----
from("platform-http:/support/message")
  .convertBodyTo(String.class)
  .to("jslt:request.jslt?allowContextMapAll=true")
  .to("amqp:topic:{{broker.amqp.topic.clients}}?disableReplyTo=true&connectionFactory=#myFactory");
----

The route above is self-describing.

. It exposes an HTTP entrypoint.
. Converts the body to a String (from Byte Stream).
. Executes a JSON transformation (to comply with the data format). 
. Pushes an AMQP message to the broker.

The JSON transformation maps input fields to output fields and follows the following rules:

[source,json]
----
{
  "user": .user,
  "text": .text,
  "source": {
    "name" : "partner",
    "uname": "partner",
    "room" : .sessionid
  }
}
----

In the transformation above, we're mapping key fields, and we're indicating the source of the message comes from `partner`.

The `sessionid` is the correlator value for the entire conversation.

{empty} +

===== Response flow

The response flow consumes messages from the AMQ Broker, sent by the support agents and are directed to the system to be integrated.

.Data flow consuming messages from AMQ
image::32-demo-extend-platform-response-flow.png[,70%,align=center]

The key Camel route to enable the above data flow is shown in this snippet:

[source,java]
----
from("amqp:topic:{{broker.amqp.topic.agents}}?connectionFactory=#myFactory")
    .convertBodyTo(String.class)
    .to("jslt:response.jslt?allowContextMapAll=true")
    .to("{{client.callback.url}}");
----

Again, a very simple route definition where:

. The consumer obtains messages from a queue in the broker.
. Converts the body to a String (from Byte Stream).
. Executes a JSON transformation (to comply with the data format). 
. Sends the data to the new system's callback URL.

The JSLT transformation would look like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "agent": .agent,
  "text": .text,
  "sessionid" : .source.room,
  "pdf":  .pdf
}
----

You can see how the `sessionid` carries the conversation correlation value, to ensure it's not mixed with other customer conversations.

That's essentially all the code you need to integrate a new system. As usual you would add to that the configuration values in a properties file, and the credentials to connect to the broker, but those are technical details.

{empty} +


==== Deploy and test the new Partner system

It's time to try it out.

From the top of your OpenShift's console, click the `⨁` button to import YAML code, as shown below:

.Import YAML code
image::33-demo-import-yaml.png[,80%]

Next, copy the YAML definitions below, and paste them into the YAML editor:

Click `Create`.

[NOTE]
Be patient, _Camel K_ will process the integration YAML, it'll take between 2-5 minutes.

After some time you'll see the integration `partner-support` deployed and running:

===== Test the request flow

To simulate the client interface, using a `curl` command, we will invoke the integration HTTP endpoint to send a message from a fictitious customer.

The OpenShift console comes with a terminal you can use. Follow the steps below to open the terminal.

. From the top of your OpenShift's console, click the `>_` button to open the terminal window:

.Action to open the terminal
image::35-demo-terminal-open.png[,80%]

Now, use the `curl` command below to send an HTTP request against the integration point to simulate the client interaction:

Press `Enter`.

You should see in _Matrix_ a new room created. Agents can now attend the client's request as usual.

===== Test the response flow

When agents respond back, the new _Partner_ integration consumes events from _AMQ Broker_ and invokes the _Partner_ callback URL.

The strategy to send asynchronous responses to the _Partner_ interface is via HTTP callbacks.

We need to put in place an HTTP process that will listen for callbacks. The Camel integration has already been pre-defined to send callbacks to the following address:

[source,bash]
----
http://partner-callback:80/partner/callback
----

Once again, you can choose the language of your liking to deploy a process ready to listen for HTTP callbacks.

We will use Camel K once more since it's so handy and simple.

From the top of your OpenShift's console, click the `⨁` button to import YAML code, as shown below:

.Import YAML code

Next, copy the YAML definition below, and paste it into the YAML editor:


[NOTE]
The source code below contains the snippets viewed earlier. They are deployed as Camel K definitions, automatically processed by the Camel K operator.

[.console-input]
[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Integration
metadata:
  name: partner-callback
  namespace: globex-integrations
spec:
  flows:
    - from:
        uri: 'platform-http:/partner/callback'
        steps:
          - convertBodyTo:
              type: String
          - to: 'log:info'
----

Click `Create`.

The Camel route above basically listens for HTTP requests, and prints out their body. The process prints the payload and we will be able to see the responses agents send from _Matrix_.

[NOTE]
Be patient, _Camel K_ will process the integration YAML, it'll take between 2-5 minutes.



After some time you'll see the `partner-callback` system deployed and running.

Open the system logs. Follow the actions below:

.Partner callback system
image::36-demo-partner-callback-logs.png[,100%]

Test your callback URL by issuing the following `curl` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl \
-H "content-type: text" \
-d "test callback" \
http://partner-callback.globex-integrations.svc:80/partner/callback
----

You should see in your logs the following trace:

----
... Exchange[ExchangePattern: InOut, BodyType: String, Body: test callback]
----

If you saw the trace, it means your callback system is ready to get agent responses.

Put your support agent hat on, and from _Matrix_, respond to the client message, for example with:

- Agent (1st line):
+
--
> Hello, how can I help a client using a terminal?
-- 

You see the response showing in the partner callback logs, with a trace similar to:

----
... Exchange[ExchangePattern: InOut, BodyType: String, Body: {"agent":"user2","text":"Hello, how can I help a user in the command line?","sessionid":"0001"}]
----

Well done! You should now be familiar with the hightlights of this Solution Pattern.
